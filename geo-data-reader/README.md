# Download boundaries

This little tool downloads the OSM-boundaries from osm-boundaries.com

You need an API-key for this (go to osm-boundaries, authenticate, click 'download' and you get an API-url. The API-key is included in there)

To install the dependencies, do

`cat requirements.txt | xargs sudo pip install`
